# ieee-latex-template
_Boilerplate for creating IEEE reports to the standard specified by UoA Engineering_

Apart from the core offering of being a basic template to avoid having to mess around with styling for every new report, this project also holds other goodies.

This includes various useful components such as:
- A working bibliography integration
- A bunch of different equation formatting strategies
- A build script
- A way to include figures
- A beautiful `code snippets` strategy
